- Make terminal use colors (e.e. for man pages)

- Install dataset with 1000 images


Topics

Morning Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Intro (15 min) + laptops setup [need slides]

  - we are not programmers

  - share best practises, from experience, nothing fancy, but basic tools that
    make life easier

- Unix shell scripting (60min) [needs script]

  45min
  - example: imagemagick mass conversion of images
             - first B&W only
             - later also same size
             - animated GIFs

  - unix philosophy: one tool for one thing [needs slides? or better as script?]
    - mention basic commands
    - 
  - example: mass renaming
             - zero padding


  - example: home dir is full, where are the big files?

- Version control (60min) [needs script]

  - prepare "fake" Git repo that contains the same development as done above to
    show difference in clarity

  - demo of "old school" version control (e.g. old_old_76.txt)

  - use Git to automate

    - importance of commit messages and tags

    - commands: init, add, tag. commit, diff, log, gitk, status

- Wrap-up (10 min) [need slides]

  - how can I do the same at home

  - what else is available

  - tour through the whole research process and mention some tools for each step
    (stimulus preparation, stimulus delivery, data analysis, data visualization,
     manuscripts, posters, talks)


Afternoon Session
-----------------

- Python (3h)

  - Intro (10min) [needs slides]

    - Pointers to other tutorials

    - Scope: glue between specialized tools

    - Potential tools/languages
      - Why Python?

  - PART1: example: convert eye-tracker output into CSV for further
                    analysis

  - write a parser -> modularize/refactor parser -> it works

  - PART2: spaghetti code (hard-coded values, cut&paste vs loops)
            -> refactor -> functions
           (focus on potential re-use of functionality in related work)

  - PART3: issue: Format change (the parser doesn't fail with an error, but produces
           non-obvious crap)

  - 1st attempt: fix issue, and test manually (repeatedly)

  - more and more "test cases" make manual testing error prone and tedious

  - PART4: automate unit tests -> show how to use nose/pytest

  - Wrapup-session (10 min) [needs slides]

    - where is Python documentation?

    - how to learn Python?

    - Python for scientific computing (numpy/scipy/pandas/matplotlib/psychopy/....)
